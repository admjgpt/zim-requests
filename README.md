# zim-requests<br>
Want a new ZIM file? Propose ZIM content improvements or fixes? Here you are!<br><br>

To request a new zim file from a website you know click `Issues` on the top menu bar, and then on the green `New Issue` button.<br>
In the new window, click on (Get Started): a pre-filled form will appear<br>

Write the title of your request (target website) in the title field, e.g. `New Zim Request: Examplepedia.com`<br>

Replace `Website URL: https://xxx` with the URL for the website you want to submit, e.g. `https://www.examplepedia.com`<br>
You **must** clarify the License field, e.g. Creative Commons, Public domain, or any other licensing format. **Do NOT request copyrighted material**<br>
In `Desired ZIM Title`: Put a clear & short title, this will be the title that will appear in the Library.<br>
In `Desired ZIM Description`: put a short description of the content. This will also appear in the library (ideally max 60 characters)<br>
In `Desired ZIM Icon â€“png`, put your icon URL, e.g., (https://examplepedia.com/example_icon.png).<br>
In Language indicate the website's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">language ISO code</a>, e.g.: **eng**. <br>
As Desired Main Page , put the URL that you want as homepage, if different from the normal homepage. <br>
Then indicate whether this is a mediawiki-based website (**yes | no**).  <br>

After submitting the issue, we will create the corresponding recipe on the <a href="https://farm.openzim.org/">zimfarm</a> and, if everything works then the zim file will automatically be added to the library (after 24-48 hours).  <br>

In case the recipe didn't work, we will investigate and keep the recipe for later fixes so you needn't open an new request.  <br>
